    <string name="history1">

        \t The earliest historical record of the City of San Pablo dates
        back to pre-Spanish times when four (4) big barrios bounded by Mt. Banahaw
        and Mt. Makiling composed Sampaloc. \n \n

        \t In 1521, Sampaloc was changed to San Pablo De Los Montes, which became
        a parish in 1556 and then a municipality in 1647. In 1899, a Municipal
        Government was established by Inocente Martinez as Municipal President
        in 1902 when the Civil Government was granted independence from the Province
        of Laguna. On May 7, 1940, the charter bill, sponsored by Congressman Tomas
        Dizon was approved. The bill became known as the City Charter of San Pablo
        or Commonwealth Act No. 520. The City was inaugurated on March 30, 1941 with Dr.
        Potenciano Malvar as the appointed City Mayor. \n \n

    <string name="history3">
        \t \t In ancient times, San Pablo was known as the village of Sampalok.
        It was an upland realm surrounded by mountain ranges and quiescent volcanic peaks.
        Belief was that mountain making movements or orogeny had thrust lower lying areas
        to uplands and low rolling plains after extensive volcanisms took place millions of
        years ago and where caesal piniaceus tamarind or sampalok trees grew in wild
        abundance. This upland realm became our hometown, San Pablo de los Montes. \n
    </string>

    <string name="Sampalok">
        \t \t Sampalok was a large and prospering village which had it\'s own system of government
        and culture. Barangays already existed and each was headed by a chieftain who
        was also known as Gatpuno. Foremost among of them were Gat Paguil, Gat Sungayan,
        Gat Salakab and Gat Pulintan. Cultural development was manifested in marriage
        patterns, religion and social groups. \n \n
        \t \t Even crude written symbols of communications
        were used to record simple trades and forms of literature although oral handing of
        customs, beliefs, songs and practices was preferred. The natives had a glimpse of
        the outside world thru Chinese traders who were the first group to be in contact
        with as evidenced by ceramic pieces that were unearthed and carbon-dated. \n
    </string>

    <string name="Spaniards">
        \t \t In search of gold the first Spanish troops under Captain Juan de Salcedo reached
        the upland realm of Sampalok in 1571 and immediately announced governance in
        the name of the king of Spain. Administration of it\'s affairs was turned over to
        the Augustinian missionaries who succeeded in converting most of the natives
        to Christianity. \n \n
        \t \t Fiesta was introduced as part of religious rituals. Consequently,
        some barangay villages were renamed after saints as a reason for the festivity.
        Native chieftains were renamed cabesa de barangay and in 1647 Sampalok was renamed
        San Pablo de los Montes in honor of St. Paul the First Hermit and became an independent
        municipality with a gobernadorcillo or capitan as it\'s head. \n \n

        \t \t Centuries of Spanish colonization of the Philippine Islands had left it\'s indelible
        imprint on the social, economic and political life of the country. In San Pablo de
        los Montes the gridiron plan for it\'s central village or cabecera had been replicated
        from communities that were founded under the Spanish empire which conspicuously
        featured a central plaza. From 1648 to 1898 249 gobernadorcillos and 94 parish priests
        had been installed in San Pablo de los Montes. \n \n

        \t \t Over the years there was genial and friendly relationship between the natives
        and the religious who wielded the civil authority. Until the flames of revolution against
        Spain that was ignited by the execution of Dr. Jose P. Rizal who was well known to the
        local citizenry had crept into San Pablo de los Montes and produced revolutionists
        and local heroes. \n \n

        \t \t In the face of impending defeat the Spanish troops left the town
        and the Philippine Flag was raised in the town plaza on June 6, 1898.
        The revolutionists led by General Juan Cailles immediately appointed prominent
        citizens as councilmen and town officials to effect local administration. \n

    <string name="american">
        \t \t The subsequent defeat of the Spanish colonizers set the stage for another war – the
        Filipino-American war and the inevitable American occupation and establishment of
        the Philippine Commonwealth. Although Manila was captured by the American troops on
        June 30, 1898 the first American cavalry arrived in San Pablo on January 14, 1900
        after taking Santa Cruz and Calamba earlier and routed the local freedom fighters. \n \n

        \t \t America’s pacification drive and grant of amnesty to freedom-fighters did much to
        quell animosity and distrust among the local citizenry and on January 24, 1901 U.S.
        military authorities appointed Don Pedro de Gorostiza as municipal president of San
        Pablo.\n \n

        \t \t Civil government in the Philippines was inaugurated on July 4, 1901.
        It was ushered in locally by the elite of San Pablo which was composed of the
        influential, wealthy and closely related families who easily dominated the fledgling
        electoral process. \n \n

        \t \t Don Marcos Paulino was the first elective municipal president of San Pablo (1902-1904).
        The other municipal presidents who succeeded him are as follows: \n \n

        1905-1907 - Don Melecio Fule \n
        1908-1910 - Don Cornelio Alcantara \n
        1911-1913 - Don Simeon Gesmundo \n
        1914-1916 - Don Marcial Alimario \n
        1916-1918 - Don Feliciano Exconde \n
        1919-1921 - Don Potenciano Cabrera \n
        1922-1924 - Don Isidoro Alvaran \n
        1925-1927 - Don Zacarias Sahagun \n

        1935-1938 - Don Inocencio Barleta \n
        1938-1940 - Don Cristeto Brion \n \n

        \t \t On May 7, 1940, San Pablo became a city thru enactment and approval of Commonwealth Act No.
        520 which was sponsored by Assemblyman Tomas Dizon. Dr. Potenciano Malvar became the first
        appointive City Mayor. \n

        On December 30, 1941 General Susuma Morioka arrived and took over San Pablo in the name
        of the invading Japanese Imperial Forces. \n \n

        \t \t World War II brought extensive damage to the city in terms of lives lost and property
        destroyed. It brought out the worst and the best in men – from the dreaded notoriety
        of the local kempetai and makapili collaborators to the admirable heroism of the local
        guerillas and freedom fighters one of whom was Cipriano B. Colago who became the first elected
        City Mayor of San Pablo. Japanese occupation ended when the American troops marched into

        issuance of Presidential Decree No. 86 dated December 31, 1972; Presidential Decree No. 86-A
        dated January 5, 1973 and Presidential Decree No. 86-B dated January 7, 1973. All these decrees
        were contributory to the creation of Citizen Assemblies or Barangays. Under these decrees 80
        barangays were created in the city. \n \n

        \t \t On February 25, 1986 the so-called EDSA Revolution or People Power Revolution broke
        out following withdrawal of support by Defense Minister Enrile and Philippine Constabulary
        Chief Fidel V. Ramos to the martial law government. President Marcos fled the country and went
        to Hawaii were he died on September 28,1989. \n \n

        \t \t A Revolutionary Government was established by President Corazon C. Aquino who was catapulted to
        power by the EDSA revolution and local government executives all over the country were either
        booted out of office or retained. In San Pablo City, Mayor Cesar P. Dizon was replaced by
        long-time political rival, former City Mayor Zacarias A. Ticzon as OIC Mayor. \n \n

        Based on this the city’s projected population for 2010 is 250,575. \n \n


        \t \t Historically, the Annual Growth Rate during the period 1960-1970 posted an all time high
        of 4.08%. This was influenced by the influx of migrant workers together with their families
        as the motor works ( jeepney body-building) industries and agri-based oil refineries boomed. \n \n

        \t \t In 1975-1995 the AGR teetered (2.01%, 2.45%, 2.07% and 2.43%) as labor demand from Calamba
        and Sta Rosa, which are now cities, and the Municipality of San Pedro sharply increased due
        to construction and subsequent operation of a number of industrial parks or manufacturing
        companies in those areas. Out-migration then was inevitable. \n \n

        \t \t The AGR continued to drop during the period 2000-2007 to 1.84% World-wide recession was looming
        and the pursuit for gainful employment became naturally acute. Diaspora ensued and soon enough
        a sizable number of city residents moved to foreign lands in search of greener pastures. Another
        aspect worth considering is the change in the lifestyle and outlook of the people. Young
        professionals or couples are more inclined to raise a smaller family usually with one or two kids.

    <string name="population_age">
        \t \t San Pablo City has a young age structure. Thirty four percent
        (34%) of the population is below age fifteen (15) years old.
        Just over sixty four percent (64%) of the population is in the
        economically productive age (15-64) and those over sixty five
        (65) years of age constitute 4.04%. This young age structure
        has two (2) primary effects: \n \n

        \t \t(1) A young age structure regardless of the total fertility
        rate or the average number of children born to a woman in her
        life time, presupposes that the population will continue to grow for
        a long time. This is because of the large number of women currently
        in their reproductive ages. This phenomenon is called population momentum. \n \n

        \t \t(2) The dependency ratio, the number of dependents (young
        people aged 0-14 and old people aged 65 and over) are being
        supported by the economically productive age group ( 15-64 years old). \n \n


        \t \t In San Pablo City, the age dependency ratio is 61.3/100persons which is
        considered high. A high dependency ratio means greater consumption and
        less saving. A youth population (0-14 years old) needs food, health care
        and education. Meeting this demand places a strain in the city government’s
        ability to provide resources for their dependent population. \n \n

        \t \t The sex ratio is 98:1 meaning there are 98 males for every 100 females.
        By age group, it is observed that under 14 years old there are more boys
        than girls while ages 15 years old and over there are more women, particularly
        in the productive age, than that of their male counterpart, implying that
        if family planning will not be fully implemented it will aggravate the
